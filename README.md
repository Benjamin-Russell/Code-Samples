# Code-Samples
Samples of recent code I have written.

SerializableObject and ObjectManager are from "Welcome to the Donut Diner" a collaborative project where we are creating a first-person lovecraftian platformer game.
These files faciliatate objects with Global Unique Identifiers so their states can be saved to a file, and loaded in later.

The rest is from my recent code library additions.
